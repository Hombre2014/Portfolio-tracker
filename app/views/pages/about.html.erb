  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-8">Phase one</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">In the first phase of the project user can register with any email. There is no confirmation email sent to the user. Just use a valid structure email address. Once you "Sign up" you are logged in and you are redirected to the "Home" page. To create your first portfolio, click on the navigation link "Portfolios" in the menu on the top. Then click on the "New portfolio button". Enter the portfolio name, account number, cash amount for opening balance and the date you want. When you click on "Create portfolio" you will see a confirmation page, from where you can go back to "Portfolios" page.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Here you can create your transactions by clicking on the button "Add transaction". This will open the "New transaction" page and here you can enter the details about the transaction. In the first phase of the project only the four major transactions types are available - "Buy", "Sell", "Sell short" and "Buy to cover". The symbols of the stocks are limited to those traded on NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) only, for now. The full listing of the stock tickers you can find <a href="https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/stock" class="text-dollar-split_blue cursor-pointer hover:text-dollar-triad_blue font-bold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> The "commission" and "fee" fields are not mandatory and by default will have a value of zero. The rest of the fields are mandatory for the transaction to be completed. Once you create the transaction you will see the confirmation page and when you go back to the "Portfolios" page you will see a new position in the portfolio, which corresponds to your transaction.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Now you will be able to see all the latest stock price and profit/loss fields calculated. If the NYSE is open at the time you are looking, you can press the button "Update prices" on the top and you will get the latest price from <a href="https://finnhub.io/" class="text-dollar-split_blue cursor-pointer hover:text-dollar-triad_blue font-bold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finnhub.</a> API in real time. The process with creating a new portfolio or new transaction can repeat as much as you want or as your portfolio cash allows you! If you have two or more portfolios you will be able to see the combined Net Worth profit/loss as a dollar amount and percentage on the very bottom of the "Portfolios" page.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">One of the main features of this application is that it tracks your profit/loss for each stock in each portfolio. For example, if you "Buy" 200 shares of TSLA and then "Sell" 100 shares you will see your profit/loss figures under "Real. P/L", which means "Realized profit/loss" column in the portfolio table. The good part is that even if you close the position (sell the remaining 100 shares), the accumulated profit/loss for this stock will be kept in the portfolio. Next time when you open a position in the same stock you will see the accumulated value under "Real. P/L".</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Once you have a position in the portfolio, you can click on the stock symbol and it will show the "Stock info" page. Here you can get the abstract of the latest 10 articles from different media outlets about the stock, look at the last four earnings surprises and see the most recent insider trading transactions. You can read the whole article by clicking on the title or "Read more" link. You can also visit the company's web site for more information.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">On the navigation menu when you click on the <a href="/pages/contact" class="text-dollar-split_blue cursor-pointer hover:text-dollar-triad_blue font-bold">CONTACT</a> link you will be able to send me a question, report a problem or suggest a new feature to be included in the later releases or simply to improve the existing one. If you are developer you can click on the <a href="https://github.com/Hombre2014/Portfolio-tracker/issues" class="text-dollar-split_blue cursor-pointer font-bold hover:text-dollar-triad_blue font-bold" target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> and go directly to GitHub issues and open a new ticket. I would like to hear about your opinion and read your feedback. It will help me to improve the application and I would like to thank you very much for your comments.</p>
